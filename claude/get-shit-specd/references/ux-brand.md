# UX Writing and Brand Notes

Goal: UI text that is clear, short, and consistent.

Rules:
- Use active voice
- Prefer specific labels over clever ones
- Error messages: say what happened, why, and what to do next
- Avoid jargon unless the user is expert
- Always include:
  - primary CTA label
  - secondary action label (if exists)
  - empty state copy
  - error state copy
  - success confirmation (toast or inline)
