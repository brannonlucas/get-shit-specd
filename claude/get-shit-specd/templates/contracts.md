## Type Contracts

Shared type definitions that multiple specs depend on. Owner spec defines the type; consumer specs import it.

| Type | Owner | Consumers | Status |
|------|-------|-----------|--------|
| {{TYPE_NAME}} | {{OWNER_SPEC}} | {{CONSUMER_SPECS}} | {{Stable/New/Conflict}} |

### Definitions

```typescript
// {{TYPE_NAME}} — Owner: {{OWNER_SPEC}}
// Consumers: {{CONSUMER_SPECS}}
{{TYPE_DEFINITION}}
```

---

## Token Contracts

Design tokens referenced across specs. Tokens must exist in the codebase or be flagged as new.

| Token | Referenced By | Status |
|-------|--------------|--------|
| {{TOKEN_NAME}} | {{SPEC_LIST}} | {{Exists/New}} |

---

## Route Contracts

Full route map with ownership. Each route has exactly one owner spec.

| Route | Owner | Method | Purpose |
|-------|-------|--------|---------|
| {{ROUTE_PATTERN}} | {{OWNER_SPEC}} | {{GET/POST/etc}} | {{DESCRIPTION}} |

---

## Component API Contracts

Shared components with agreed-upon props interfaces.

| Component | Owner | Consumers |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| {{COMPONENT_NAME}} | {{OWNER_SPEC}} | {{CONSUMER_SPECS}} |

### Props Interfaces

```typescript
// {{COMPONENT_NAME}} — Owner: {{OWNER_SPEC}}
// Consumers: {{CONSUMER_SPECS}}
{{PROPS_INTERFACE}}
```

## File Ownership Matrix

Every file referenced across specs, classified by ownership.

### Exclusive (one spec creates, no others touch)

| File | Owner |
|------|-------|
| {{FILE_PATH}} | {{OWNER_SPEC}} |

### Shared (modified by multiple specs — coordinate merges)

| File | Modified By |
|------|-------------|
| {{FILE_PATH}} | {{SPEC_LIST}} |

### Conflicts (created by multiple specs — MUST resolve before dispatch)

| File | Claimed By | Resolution |
|------|-----------|------------|
| {{FILE_PATH}} | {{SPEC_LIST}} | {{PENDING/RESOLVED: description}} |

---

## Dispatch Guidance

Recommended dispatch order based on dependency graph.

### Wave 1 (no dependencies — start immediately)
- **{{SPEC_ID}}:** {{BRANCH_NAME}} — owns {{FILE_COUNT}} files, no contract dependencies

### Wave 2 (depends on Wave 1 contracts)
- **{{SPEC_ID}}:** {{BRANCH_NAME}} — depends on {{DEPENDENCY_LIST}} from Wave 1

### Per-Spec Summary

#### {{SPEC_ID}}: {{SPEC_NAME}}
- **Branch:** `feature/{{SLUG}}`
- **Exclusive files:** {{FILE_LIST}}
- **Shared files:** {{FILE_LIST}}
- **Consumes:** {{TYPE/COMPONENT_LIST}} from {{OTHER_SPECS}}
- **Provides:** {{TYPE/COMPONENT_LIST}} to {{OTHER_SPECS}}
